# probabilistic_microstates
MATLAB code used for the Frontiers paper on probabilistic microstates by Dinov M and Leech R

Analysis code is included here, except some graphing/plotting bits, which are obvious and can be tuned to plot things in any number of ways.

I've also added the channel location file for the data, needed when calling topoplot to plot the microstate templates. Also note that a number of the functions here dependent on EEGLAB and a few standard EEGLAB-acquirable plugins, including the filtering methods, the BSS-based data preprocessing/cleaning plugin, as well as the method for importing the files.
